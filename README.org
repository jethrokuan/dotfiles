* Jethro's =dotfiles=
I have 2 main machines:
1. Dell XPS 13 (2016) 
2. Custom-built Desktop with dual-monitor

Both machines run [[http://nixos.org][NixOS]] 17.03pre, and [[https://github.com/stumpwm/stumpwm/][StumpWM]] as the window manager.
I'm a huge fan of the Lisp dialect, and use Emacs as my daily runner.

*Setup as of Jul 2017*

** Installation
My dotfiles are managed wih =stow=, which is readily available from
your nearest package manager.

1. clone the repository : =git clone
   https://github.com/jethrokuan/dotfiles.git ~/= Important: it must be
   cloned in your $HOME for .stowrc files to work as expected
2. execute =stow stow= first to install stow global ignore file

** TODO
- Configure mbsync again, with notmuch on Emacs
